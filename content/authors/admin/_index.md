I am a Consultant Cardiac Radiologist and Senior Clinical Research Fellow at the University of Sheffield. I develop and evaluate machine learning applications in cardiac imaging for automated diagnosis, anatomical segmentation and prognostic assessment. My current research combines deep learning image analysis and report generation to  automate cardiac MRI assessment. My research garnered publication in prestigious radiology, cardiology and respiratory medicine journals. It has also gained recognition in European guidelines and international and national awards. 

I am an elected member of the executive committee of the British Society of Cardiovascular Imaging (BSCI), member of the academic committee of the Royal College of Radiologists and deputy editor for Radiology: Cardiothoracic Imaging. I have previously co-chaired the Trainee Committees of both the BSCI and the British Society of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (BSCMR) and dedicated my tenure to advance cardiac imaging teaching by organising the BSCI 2024 Annual Conference and the BSCMR 2023 Webinar series.
