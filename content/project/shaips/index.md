Segmenting all cardiac MRI sequences including localisers, long-axis cines (4-chambers, 3-chambers, 2-chambers, RV-RA), short-axis cines, T1 and T2 maps and late gadolinium enhancement. This is a project performed in collaboration with Professor Rob Van der Geest at Leiden University Medical Center. 

SHAIPS segmentations are now used clinically at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals with more than 7,000 patients having benefited from this technology. This project was awarded the NHS Parliamentary Award - Future of NHS in 2023, Medipex NHS Innovation Award in 2022, finalist for the HSJ Innovation Award in 2022. In addition, the research underlying the validation of the project was awarded the RSNA Cardiac Research Award in 2021.
