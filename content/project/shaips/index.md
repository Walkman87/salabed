The SHAIPS project focuses on the automated segmentation of all cardiac MRI sequences, including short- and long-axis cines (four-, three-, and two-chamber, and RV–RA views), T1 and T2 myocardial mapping, phase-contrast flow, late gadolinium enhancement, and localiser images. This work has been conducted in collaboration with Professor Rob van der Geest at the Leiden University Medical Center.

SHAIPS-derived segmentations are now implemented in routine clinical workflows at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, where more than 7,000 patients have benefited from this technology. The project was recognised with the NHS Parliamentary Award – Future of the NHS (2023) and the Medipex NHS Innovation Award (2022), and was a finalist for the HSJ Innovation Award (2022). The underlying research validating the technology earned me the RSNA Cardiac Research Prize (2021).

I led dataset curation, manual segmentation, data labelling, and model validation, benchmarking outputs against invasive haemodynamic measurements and expert manual segmentations.
