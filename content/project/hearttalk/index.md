HeartTalk is a project that aims to automate report generation for cardiac MRI scans using natural language processing and rule based reporting. The output is based on the results of the segmentation of the cardiac MRI scans ([SHAIPS](https://yourdomain.com/shaips)) to generate a draft report that can be reviewed and edited by the reporting radiologist. 
I have been working on this project since 2023 and it is currently in beta testing phase for clinical use at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals.
