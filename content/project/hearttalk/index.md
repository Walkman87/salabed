HeartTalk is a project designed to automate report generation for cardiac MRI using natural language processing (NLP) and rule-based reporting. The system generates structured draft reports from the results of cardiac MRI segmentation produced by [SHAIPS](/project/shaips), which can then be reviewed and edited by the reporting radiologist.

I have been developing this project since 2023, and it is currently in beta testing for clinical deployment at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals.
