[PyKale](https://github.com/pykale/pykale?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use) is an open-source Python library developed in Sheffield for feature extraction from cardiac MRI scans. I contributed to this project by curating training and testing datasets, labelling imaging data, and validating diagnostic and prognostic models.

Machine learningâ€“based feature extraction on cardiac MRI has demonstrated strong performance in diagnosing and predicting prognosis in pulmonary hypertension, supporting the development of explainable, reproducible, and clinically relevant AI tools in cardiovascular imaging.
