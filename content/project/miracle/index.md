Radiology reports are often difficult for patients and non-specialists to understand. The MIRACLE project, which stands for Medical Imaging Reports Accessible and Clear for Everyone, aims to improve the accessibility and clarity of radiology reports through the use of large language models (LLMs). These models can simplify complex medical text by rewriting reports in plain language and explaining technical terminology in a patient-friendly way.

This pilot study, funded by the ESPRC South Yorkshire Digital Health Hub and the Topol Digital Fellowship, represents the first step towards developing an intelligent tool to help patients better understand their imaging results. The extended project is currently being developed as an NIHR Post-Doctoral Fellowship proposal to translate this research into real-world patient care.
