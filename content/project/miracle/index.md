Radiology reports are often difficult to understand for patients and non-specialists. The MIRACLE project stands for Medical Imaging Reports Accessible and Clear for Everyone and aims to improve the accessibility and clarity of radiology reports by using large language models (LLMs). LLMs can make complex text easier to understand by rewriting it in simpler terms and explaining medical jargon. 

This pilot study is funded by the South Yorkshire Digital Health Hub and the Topol Digital Fellowship and is the first step towards developing a tool that can help patients better understand their radiology reports. The extended project is currently written up as an NIHR fellowship grant application to help bring this project to real life patient care.
